## TODOS:  
- Login page(stores token)  
- Register page  
- Ping auth route(verifies token)  
- Home page (only after login, verify token)  
- Setup navigation in client (app.jsx)
- Keep ignoring the fact that it's horribly structured, because it's just for learning purposes

## Login Page
- Create a login page component in client
- Create a login route in app.jsx
- Fetch token with credentials
- Store the token in httponly cookie

## Register Page
- Create a register page component in client
- Create a register route in app.jsx
- Send register request to server

## Ping Auth Route
- Create a route in the server that verifies the token

## Home Page
- Create some sort of home page that only shows if the token is verified
